* Check vpara/vshuffle mask types to be immediate values during code generation (not checked at typecheck step)
* More generally maybe introduce notion of immediate values, also maybe needed for DATA
* Introduce actual VPARAM type
* Sort out VPARAM subtypes.
* See where Arrays are actually vectors and where they are just arrays
* Clarify vec/array casts in `check_coercion`
